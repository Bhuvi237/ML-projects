# Project name
Titanic Survival Prediction

-A machine learning project to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using data from Kaggle. The project includes data cleaning,  handling missing values, outlier detection, encoding features, EDA and feature extraction.

# Description
This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to understand the key factors that influenced passenger survival. The dataset contains demographic and travel information for passengers on the Titanic.

Using Python, pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn, the project explores and visualizes the data, handles missing values using imputation, removes outliers using boxplots and IQR, and builds predictive models like Logistic Regression and predicts whether passenger survived.


# Features and Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Missing Value Imputation (mean/mode)
- Outlier Detection and Removal (Boxplot + IQR)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Feature extraction

# Dataset Source
Kaggle Titanic Dataset
